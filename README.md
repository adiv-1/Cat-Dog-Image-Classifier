# Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier

### Build and train a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow to classify cat and dog images with at least 60% accuracy

This project is a freeCodeCamp (FCC) challenge where I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colaboratory, the goal was to build a model that achieves at least 63% accuracy in distinguishing between cat and dog images, with extra credit for surpassing 70% accuracy. The project involves data preparation, model design, training, and evaluation, following detailed instructions and code provided in the challenge notebook.
